# Guidelines

## Default values implies disabled feature

Every feature defaults to a value that matches the vanilla game experience.
The default value implies that the feature should be disabled, 
since the default should lead to a vanilla game experience. 
For maximum mod compatibility, disabled features should be unobtrusive.
