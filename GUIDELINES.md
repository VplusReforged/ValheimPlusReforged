# Guidelines

## Default values implies disabled feature

Every feature defaults to a value that matches the vanilla game experience.
The default value implies that the feature should be disabled, 
since the default should lead to a vanilla game experience.

## Fully Unhook Patches when Disabled

Patches should not be applied when the user has disabled a feature. 
This is to ensure maximum compatibility with other mods.
